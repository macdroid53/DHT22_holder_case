# DHT22_holder_case
FreeCAD design for a case and cover for the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor

This design has groves to fit a 4 position MOLEX Series 2695 PN 0022013047 connector and mate directly to the legs of the DHT22.

The body of the DHT22 is not enclosed allowing full air flow for good thermal performance. THe DHT22 is held onto the base of the case with a screw through the hole on the DHT22.

The lid snaps on or can be held on with a dab of CA glue or other adhesive.

There are holes for wire access and fastening to another case.
